#### Objectives:

To find a junior js-developer position that would utilize my skills in JavaScript / node.js / ReactJS / Redux development.

#### Summary:

It's important to me to finish tasks in time, pay attention to the details of the task and write a clear, reliable and nice-looking code. I always use best practices and test my work carefully and thoroughly. I am familiar with "code review" and "unit test coverage of a code" techniques. I have a lot of experience of working with Agile methodology using JIRA and Redmine.

#### Software languages and skills:

- JavaScript/ES6 [basic knowledge], jQuery, ReactJS, Redux
- SQL (MySQL)
- HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, BEM, Gulp, SASS, GIt

#### Experience

##### WebDev Company Ltd.

*Highlights*

Working as a Consultant to both a social enterprise campaign and multinational corporation, being able to view my work history on GitHub and see how far I've progressed in such a short time frame though helping others and my own tireless perseverance

*Responsibilities*

- Give consultancy advice to a multinational corporation on how to improve their website design and build and what steps they need to take: [Bora Plastics](http://www.boraplastik.com.tr/english) are now developing responsive design and improving their UI/UX
- Create a ticketing site for the established Burlesque dancer [Tabitha Taboo](http://www.tabithataboo.com/) and her event: [The Secret Drawing Room](https://github.com/Mervodactyl/TheSecretDrawingRoom)
- Give talks to schools both [Primary](http://www.tufnellpark.islington.sch.uk/) and [Secondary](http://www.holloway.islington.sch.uk/) about STEM careers, increased applications into technical fields this year as a result
- Aid a social enterprise [campaign](http://hardedgesthestories.com/) who needed more flexibility with their site despite constraints, they are now following my recommendation and moving onto a more flexible hosting platform

#### Education

Full Stack Graduate, [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) - ref. previous section

**Academy Student & Self Taught Development**

- Highly selective 12 week Web Development programme, with interview exam based entry
- Focused learning on best practices across the board including TDD and OOP, Front and Backend, agile formats
- Decided to fully commit to code and spent the last year developing new skill set

#### Interests

In my spare time you will find me writing readable, maintainable, tested code. You will also find me shamelessly feeding my book addiction, sketching on my art pad, mastering Wing Chun Kung Fu, or swinging from an Aerial hoop in Circus school. If given the tiniest opportunity, I will tell you why Digimon is superior to Pok√©mon.

#### Appendix

##### [1] Github projects

- **patina**
  A Node.JS based pattern library generator. Currently work in progress, but it represents a consolidation of how I like to build frontend pattern libraries if left to my own devices! (Naturally as a contractor, I am also an expert at fitting in to *your*way of working.)
- **conduct.js**
  This is a JavaScript plugin for registering media query specific callbacks allowing you to run different bits of code at different viewport resolutions. Written during my time at CX Partners.
- **andymantell.com**
  Repository for my new work in progress portfolio site. Custom built using Grunt.js to compile XML down to static HTML using XSLT. This will then be hosted on an Amazon S3 bucket for supremely fast response times. Semi-dynamic content such as Twitter feeds, Last.fm recent tracks etc will be pulled down nightly in a cron task running on my Raspberry PI before rebuilding the production site. Note: this is an exercise in learning and trying new things, not necessarily a recommended production setup!
